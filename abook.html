				I am a writer, blogger and multidisciplinary researcher working in the Islamic scholarly tradition, Western philosophy and the life sciences. I aim to get a PhD in philosophy. I am also a software engineer with a degree in Internet technologies and usability.I love Western civilization and consider it partly the heir of classical Islamic civilization, which itself was partly the heir of Greek civilization. Each civilization inherits some ideas and develops many of its own. Byzantine civilization had Greek learning and Christianity and managed to do nearly nothing with them for 1000 years.
